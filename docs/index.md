# What is the Base EDA Extension?

The EDA (Epidemiological Disturbance Agent) extention is created and maintained by the Center for Geospatial Analytics, North Carolina State University, in collaboration with the USDA Forest Service Northern Research Station, Institute for Applied Ecosystem Studies. The extension is meant to provide a framework to simulate multi-host asymmetric epidemiological processes for the establishment and transmission of a given disease. The extension is climate-driven, thus make use of the [LANDIS-II] (http://www.landis-ii.org/) climate library, as most epidemiological agents (pathogens) are influenced by it. EDA is built upon some of the foundations of the BDA (biological disturbance agent) extension, while adding some extra components to it, such as probabilistic and anisotropic dispersal.
